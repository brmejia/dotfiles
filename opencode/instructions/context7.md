# Context7 MCP

Always use Context7 MCP when you need library/API/framework documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps, or when there is any doubt about syntax or functionality.

## Identification (using context7_resolve-library-id)

IMPORTANT: Context7 seems to be case-sensitive. (e.g. Rust library was not found as `ractor` but `Ractor`)

1. First try to identify the library only by name, without additional query
2. if it doesn't work, test some keyword combinations

## Documentation
Once the library is identified, use the context given by the user to look for specific focumentation
